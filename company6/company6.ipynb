    "Intuitively both expressions are approximatively $3^3$, yet $e \\approx 2.8$ and $\\pi \\approx 3.14$. Hence the exponential being usually faster than the product, $e^\\pi$ is probably bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us check whether $e^\\pi < \\pi^e$ is false.\n",
    "- 1st idea: use the logarithm in order to transform these exponentials into products and maybe use $len(e) = 1$ As both expressions are >1 and $ln \\nearrow \\in ]1, +\\infty[$ this won't change the direction of the inequality : $e^\\pi < \\pi^e \\implies ln\\left(e^\\pi\\right) < ln\\left(\\pi^e\\right) \\Leftrightarrow \\pi = \\pi ln(e) < e ln(\\pi)$\n",
    "- 2nd idea divide both terms by $e\\pi$. Since this is a positive number, it won't affect the direction of the <. this yields $\\frac{ln(e)}{e} < \\frac{ln(\\pi)}{\\pi}$. Is this true?\n",
    "- 3rd idea. Let us check whether $f : x \\rightarrow f(x) = \\frac{ln(x)}{x} \\nearrow R_+^*$ In order to do so we'll use formula $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)' = \\frac{f'g - g'f}{g^2}$ and compute $$f'(x) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{x} x - 1 * ln(x)}{x^2} = \\frac{1 - ln(x)}{x^2}$$. The denominator is >0 on $R_+^*$ and the numerator is < 0 on ]1,$+\\infty$[. Hence f is $\\searrow$ on ]1,$+\\infty$[ \n",
    "- Conclusion: as $1 < e<\\pi$ and f is $\\searrow$ on ]1,$+\\infty$[, $\\frac{len(e)}{e} > \\frac{len(\\pi)}{\\pi}$ and therefore $e^\\pi$ > $\\pi^e$ as ln and exp are growing on this range."
