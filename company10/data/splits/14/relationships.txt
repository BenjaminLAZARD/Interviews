```txt
* Adélaïde Fouque -> Antoine Macquart [married]
* Adélaïde Fouque -> Silvère Mouret [parent]
```

**Explanation:**

- The text describes [Adélaïde Fouque] and [Antoine Macquart] as lovers ("[Adélaïde Fouque] se pendait à son cou, [Adélaïde Fouque] restait sur sa poitrine...") in a way that in the context of the family tree, and as per the conventions of the Rougon-Macquart genealogy, is typically interpreted as a marital/parental relationship.
- [Silvère Mouret] is described as being raised by [Adélaïde Fouque] and is her "enfant", indicating a [parent] relationship.
- No other direct relationships between Rougon-Macquart family members are explicitly mentioned in this excerpt.

If you want further breakdowns (such as the connection from Adélaïde to Mouret, or to Ursule), or if you want to process another excerpt, let me know!
