**Explanation of relationships found in the text:**
- The text clearly establishes that Pierre Rougon is the son of Adélaïde Fouque and that Félicité Rougon becomes his wife.
- It details that Pierre and Félicité have three sons: Eugène, Pascal, Aristide, and later, two daughters: Marthe and Sidonie.
- Aristide is said to have a son, Maxime (with Angèle, who is not Rougon-Macquart, so her relationship is not listed).
- Antoine Macquart is mentioned as the brother of Pierre Rougon and thus also a child of Adélaïde Fouque.
