**Notes:**
- Because the only explicit relationship in this chunk is "cousin" between Silvère Mouret and Pascal Rougon, but both are Rougon-Macquart, and you requested to break down cousin into parent/parent, I've added "unknown1" as the parent of Silvère (since Pascal's parent is Pierre). This can be replaced by Ursule Mouret + Mouret once the whole tree is clear.
- All other relationships are inferred from the established family structure in the list (since the text here doesn't break down all parenthoods but the task is to build the tree for later DAG building).
- "married" is used only where the text or list confirms it (Pierre/Félicité, Mouret/Ursule).
- If you want only relationships strictly mentioned or implied in this text chunk, you can reduce the output to just the cousin relationship (and its break down), and the married ones, but typically the family tree structure is repeated from context as above.

Let me know if you want a more restrictive extraction (strictly only what is in this text chunk and nothing else)!
