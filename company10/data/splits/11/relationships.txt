### Explanation

- **Direct textual evidence in this chunk:**
    - "le fils d’Aristide" → *Aristide Rougon* is parent of *Maxime Rougon*.
    - "sa mère" (par Aristide, in name mapping) → *Félicité Rougon* is parent of *Aristide Rougon*.
    - "mon mari" (for Félicité) → *Pierre Rougon* married to *Félicité Rougon*.
    - *Antoine Macquart* recounting his children (*Gervaise Macquart* and *Jean Macquart*) leaving him and referring to them as "ses enfants".

- **Inferred from consistent name/role mapping (from your names list):**
    - All children of *Pierre Rougon* and *Félicité Rougon* (Eugène, Aristide, Pascal, Marthe, Sidonie).
    - *Adélaïde Fouque* is parent to both *Pierre Rougon* and *Antoine Macquart* (and Ursule Mouret, not directly in this text, but standard to the family tree).
    - *Ursule Mouret* is parent of *François Mouret*, again for completeness.

#### Note:
- "unknown" nodes are not required here as all direct relationships are covered by listed characters.
- If you want to limit strictly to relationships directly mentioned in THIS CHUNK, remove any line that is only inferred from the names list and not directly referenced here.
- If you want the strictest subset, the lines that are directly evidenced in this chunk are:
