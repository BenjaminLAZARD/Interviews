* tante Dide -> Silvère Mouret [parent]
```

**Explanation**:  
From the text, we learn that Silvère Mouret vit auprès de sa grand’mère ([tante Dide]), which establishes a parent-child link (Silvère is the grandchild, but since we prefer "parent" relationships and go downwards, we only record tante Dide as parent to Silvère's parent in other steps).  
No other Rougon-Macquart relationships are established in this chunk.  
If more context on Ursule Mouret or other Rougon-Macquart members were provided, more links could be added.  
No "married" relationships are indicated in this chunk.  
No need for "unknown" placeholders in this step.
