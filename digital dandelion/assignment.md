# Assignment

Objective: Your task is to design and implement a prototype for a Natural User Interface, specifically a "talking heads avatar" that operates with minimal latency. This prototype should facilitate an intuitive interaction using a voice-to-text-to-voice-to-video pipeline.

Prototype Design:

Architecture: Implement a sequence starting with voice to text conversion (using models like Whisper), followed by processing through a Chat-based Language Model (such as a 3B-parameter Tiny Chat LLM), and concluding with text to voice and voice to video conversion.
Skills and Competencies:

Research: Investigate and identify the most suitable models for each component of the architecture, focusing on those optimized for low latency and high fidelity.
Selection and Justification: Analyze available options, understand their trade-offs, and provide a well-reasoned justification for your chosen solutions.
Technical Setup: Efficiently configure the necessary environments, whether cloud-based or local, including code environments and repositories.
Integration: Demonstrate your ability to integrate disparate technologies into a seamless pipeline.
Resilience and Problem-Solving: Exhibit perseverance and innovative problem-solving skills throughout the project.
Enhancement and Efficiency: Propose enhancements and identify any inefficiencies within the prototype, suggesting viable improvements.
